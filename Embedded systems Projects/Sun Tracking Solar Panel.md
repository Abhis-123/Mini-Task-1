### Project 17 - SUN TRACKING SOLAR PANEL

__Description__ -

A Sun tracking solar panel is a project that aims to utilize maximum solar energy by continously rotating a solar panel in the direction of Sun in order to achieve maximun energy intensity. The Sun tracking solar panel would consist of two LDRs, solar panel, a servo motor and ATmega328 Micro controller.

Two Light Dependent Resistors(LDR) would be placed at two ends of the solar panel. A servo motor would be used to control the rotaion of solar panel. LDR's produce low resistance when light falls on them. The microcontroller would be programmed in such a way that the intensity of light falling on two LDR's would be compared and and panel is rotated towards LDR which has high intensity i.e. low resistance compared to the other. Servo motor would rotate the panel depending upon the signal from microcontroller.

When the intensity of the light falling on right LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards right and if intensity on the left LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards left. In the noon time, Sun is overhead and intensity of light on both the panels is same. In such cases, position of the panel is constant and there is no rotation.
