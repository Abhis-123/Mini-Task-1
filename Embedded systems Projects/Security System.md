### Project 19 - SECURITY SYSTEM

__Description__ -

Here we make a door security system. The idea is to use a hall magnetic sensor to indicate whether a door is open or closed. An Arduino can then be programmed in such a way that it shows a green light in an RGB LED if the door is closed, blue light if the door is open and red light if the door is open for too long. 

An Arduino code can be written which counts the duration the door has remained open. The Arduini microcntroller would first sense signal from the Hall sensor about the door lock. Depending upon the signal, the microcontroller would send the required signal to the RGB LED.
