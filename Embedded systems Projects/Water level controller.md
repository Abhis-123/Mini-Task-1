### Project 18 - WATER LEVEL CONTROLLER

__Description__-

Water Level Controller using 8051 Microcontroller will help in automatically controlling the water motor by sensing the water level in a tank. This system monitors the water level of the tank and automatically switches ON the motor whenever tank is empty.

In this system, water sensing can be done by using a set of 4 wires, which are placed at different levels in tank. This system mainly works on a principle that “water conducts electricity”. The four wires which are dipped into the tank will indicate the different water levels. Based on the outputs of these wires, microcontroller displays water level on LCD as well as controls the motor.

Initially when the tank is empty, LCD will display the message LOW and motor runs automatically. When water level reaches to half level, now LCD displays HALF and still motor runs. When the tank is full, LCD displays FULL and motor automatically stops. Again, the motor runs when water level in the tank becomes LOW.
