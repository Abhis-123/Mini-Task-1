### Project 14 - SMART TRASH CAN 

__Description__-

This concept aims to design an IOT based trashcan that will automatically and continuously intimate the status of the trashcan to the Municipality.

The garbage can would consist of sensors used to detect the amount and type of waste dropped. The sensors would then send these signal to the microcontroller which checks if the waste is degradable or nondegradable. It can then separate the waste pulled into corresponding container in the garbage can.

When the waste is filled the sensor sensed  signal is passed to the controller and then to the Raspberry module. ESP2866 would be connected with the Raspberry module,the signal from the raspberry is sent over internet to the mobile or wifi in the area so the data is transmitted to the cloud server and the message is sent to the mobile application of the Municipality nearby.
