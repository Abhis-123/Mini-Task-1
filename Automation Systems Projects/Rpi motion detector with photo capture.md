### Project 7 - Rpi MOTION DETECTOR WITH PHOTO CAPTURE

__Description__ - 

This project based on Rpi shows how to take photos with an Rpi camera when a motion is detected. There are many applications of these projects including burglar detection, wildlife photgraphy etc. A code can be written in Python Programming language in such a way that the Rpi camera captures a photo only when motion is detected. We can use Python's inbuilt picamera library which would make it easy to control the camera.

A motion sensor will obviously have to be attached to detect any sort of motion for the camera to operate.
