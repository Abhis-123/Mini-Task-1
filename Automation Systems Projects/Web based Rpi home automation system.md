### Project 7 - WEB-BASED RPi HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM

__Description__ -

This project aims to build a technology that will allow us to control any appliance in our home or workplace from anywhere in the world using normal http protocols. Several devices available today have the abiity to communicate over internet. Hence, this technology would use sensors to pass data over internet to these devices.

The web-based system comprises of two parts- client and server. Here, server is the web interface consisting of several buttons and commands that will allow the user turn a device on or off. The client side would consist of an Rpi with a relay circuit which runs a python program used to post a URL link. The Rpi constantly reads the contents of the URL link. After reading the data, the python program checks for any changes if a particular button/switch is ON/OFF. Based on its output, it switches On/OFF the relay circuit.

Such automation systems can be used to control appliances in the home like lights, door locks, and air conditioning through a web interface or smartphone application.
