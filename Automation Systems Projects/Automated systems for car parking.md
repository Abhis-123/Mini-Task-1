### Project 9 - AUTOMATED CAR PARKING SYSTEMS

__Description__ - 

An automated system for car parking will certainly reduce human efforts especially in the places where there is a severe problem for car parking systems. The project involves a system including an infrared transmitter and receiver in every lane and an LED & LCD display outside the car parking gate. So the person entering the parking area can view the LED display and can decide which lane to enter so as to park the car. For this task a display unit is installed on the entrance of the parking lot which will show LEDs for all parking slots and for all parking lanes. An empty slot is indicated by the respective glowing LED.

IR transmitters and IR receivers would be used for each parking slot. The IR Receivers are connected to microcontrollers. IR rays are obstructed when a car is parked in any parking slot. Thus the control system will come to know which slot is empty and which slot is full. The subsequent output then can be displayed on the LED screen.

Here, IR module is advantageous over RF module beacuse of its LOS (Line OF Sight) Communication with the transmitter. Subsequently, these IR LED's can be driven can be driven by a 555 Timer IC.
