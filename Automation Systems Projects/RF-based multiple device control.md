### Project6 - RF BASED MULTIPLE DEVICE CONTROL

__Description__-

This project aims to build an automation system to control electronic and electrical gadgets from a remote location using RF transmission. Here, RF transmission is preferred over IR transmission because of its long ranger range. The signal is transmitted by an RF transmitter and correspondingly received by an RF transmitter to switch on or switch off the desired device.

The above shows the block diagram for RF-based multiple device control using microcontroller. When any key is pressed, data is passed to the encoder and then to the RF transmitter from where it is transmitted. The RF receiver receives this data and gives it to the RF decoder. The decoder serially converts the serial bit data into four-bit data at a port of microcontroller. The microcontroller energises the corresponding relay through a relay driver. Devices are connected to normally-open (N/O) contacts of the relays. Hence, any of the 15 devices can be operated by the desired input on the keypad.
