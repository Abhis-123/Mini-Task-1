_Project 2 - RUBIKS CUBE SOLVING ROBOT_
(Difficulty - High)

_Description_ - 
             This project aims to build a rubiks cube solving robot that utilized image processing, Kociemba's algorithm, and servos acting as claws/arms to turn the cube. The analysis of different faces of the cube can be done using an image processing package in python, OpenCV. After processing the 6 images of 6 faces, the code can then pass the input to an algorithm named Kociemba's Algorithm.
             The algorithm can be implemented using python. This package is published on PyPI and can be installed with: $ pip install kociemba. The information about Kociemba's algorithm can be found on Herbert Kociemba's website.
