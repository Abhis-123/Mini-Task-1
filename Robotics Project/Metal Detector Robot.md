### Project 4 - METAL DETECTOR ROBOTIC VEHICLE

__Description__ -

The main object of this project is to design a robotic vehicle to detect metals and land mines.

In this project, a metal detector is embedded in the robot and that is controlled by using RF communication.At the transmitter end, the number of push buttons is interfaced to the microcontroller to run the robot in a particular motion.

When the button is pressed, then the signal is sent to the microcontroller which sends the a binary data to the button. The encoder is used to convert parallel data to serial data and this command is transmitted using RF module.
At the receiver end, this signal is decoded by the decoder.Based on the signal, the microcontroller gives related signals to the motor driver to drive the motors. So that the robot moves in desired motion. A metal detector is embedded in the robot circuit that detects the metal and gives an indication by using a buzzer.
