### Project 1 - LINE FOLLOWING ROBOT

Description:-
            A Line following robot is a basic robot that follows a speific path indicated by a line. The robot assembly essentially needs a 8051 microcontroller, IR sensors(atleast two), chassis for motor and a driver IC. The robot direction of motion depends on the two sensors outputs. When the two sensors are on the line of path, robot moves forward. If the left sensor moves away from the line, robot moves towards right. Similarly, if right sensor moves away from the path, robot moves towards its left. Whenever robot moves away from its path it is detected by the IR sensor. Thus depending on the output of IR sensor microcontroller indicates the motors to change their direction.
