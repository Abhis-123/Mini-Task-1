### Project3 - VIRTUAL TELEPRESENCE ROBOT

__Description__ - 

This robot would use an Rpi module and Rpi camera to capture images of remote areas and display it on a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. An added feature allows the camera to move in the direction of the user’s head movements. This gives the user a real-time experience as if he is present where the virtual telepresence robot is located.

The virtual telepresence robot can also be moved in any direction through an app installed in the user’s smartphone. The smartphone would read the accelerometer abd magnetometer data from the users headset movement. This data would then be sent over Wifi to The Rpi module and from there to the servos. Two Servo motors would be fitted onto the camera, one for vertical movement and the the other for horizontal movement. As a result, the camera would move in the same direction as the users headset.

In short, Rpi receives input from the smartphone via WiFi and then sends controlling pulse to the servo motors to move the Rpi Camera. The same smartphone can also be used to provide input via bluetooth to the Arduino Mega board for the purpose of movement or navigation of the virtual telepresence robot.
